    <h1>Portfolio undergoing construction...</h1>
    <p>I had an old portfolio where you can find
        <a href="index.v2.html">HERE</a>. Currently working on a new portfolio, because looking back, my old one was real sloppy. As I learned more
        I got more annoyed by my old code, thus the new Portfolio I'm working on!</p>

    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Blog Page</h3>
            <p>First personal project I worked on. Small blog page that I was planning on using for food. Didn't like how it
                turned out, and fixing it was above my level at the time. May re-do.</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="blog.html">Blog Page</a>

            <h3>Old Portfolio Page</h3>
            <p>My old portfolio, second personal project I worked on. Had a cool vision for design revolving around Marvin Visions.
                Javascript was kind of sloppy, and has a few bottlenecks in terms of animation efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Beer Detectives</h3>
            <p>This is our first group project. Grouped with two other people, we decided to create a website to tackle the
                lack of beer information when searching. Uses three APIs, Untappd, Punk, and Google Maps. I designed the
                prototype wireframe, as well as the javascript flow.</p>
